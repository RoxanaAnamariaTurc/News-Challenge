### Getting Started

Fork and clone this project on your local machine
Use npm i to install dependecies
Use npm start to have the program starting in your default browser

### Project Review

This project was a good start to put in practice React knowledge but will need more work to have a better functionality


### Potential Next Steps for the Project

With more research and study on React this project can be improved to use the Guardian API and not the mock data to retrieve news
